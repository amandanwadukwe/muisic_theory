            Muisic.theory is a piano based music theory course. It reduces music theory as we know it to small chunks of recognisable paterns. This is so building music pieces is understood as nothing more complex than connecting the dots.
This course consists of 3 modules. After each module your knowledge is then tested. Have fun learning with US!

Muisic.theory is written and developed by Amanda Obiajulu Nwadukwe. Amanda is 21 years old. She is a developer and lives in Lancaster where she attends Lancaster and Morecambe College.
